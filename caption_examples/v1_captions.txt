PHOENIX, "JOKER."
>> Announcer: THIS IS THE FIRST
OSCAR AND FOURTH NOMINATION FOR
JOAQUIN PHOENIX.
>> HI.
WHAT'S UP?
HI.
GOD, I'M FULL OF SO MUCH
GRATITUDE RIGHT NOW AND I DO NOT
FEEL ELEVATED ABOVE ANY OF MY
FELLOW NOMINEES OR ANYONE IN
THIS ROOM, BECAUSE WE SHARE THE
SAME LOVE, THE LOVE OF FILM AND
THIS FORM OF EXPRESSION HAS
GIVEN ME THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY
LIFE.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D BE WITHOUT
IT.
BUT I THINK THE GREATEST GIFT
THAT IT HAS GIVEN ME, AND MANY
OF US IN THIS ROOM, IS THE
OPPORTUNITY TO USE OUR VOICE FOR
THE VOICELESS.
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT
SOME OF THE DISTRESSING ISSUES
THAT WE ARE FACING COLLECTIVELY
AND I THINK AT TIMES WE FEEL OR
ARE MADE TO FEEL THAT WE
CHAMPION DIFFERENT CAUSES.
BUT FOR ME, I SEE COMMONALITY.
I THINK WHETHER WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT GENDER INEQUALITY OR
RACISM OR QUEER RIGHTS OR
INDIGENOUS RIGHTS OR ANIMAL
RIGHTS, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE
FIGHT AGAINST THE BELIEF, ONE
NATION, ONE RACE, ONE GENDER OR
ONE SPECIES HAS THE RIGHT TO
DOMINATE, CONTROL AND USE AND
EXPLOIT ANOTHER WITH IMPUNIMPUN.
I THINK THAT WE'VE BECOME VERY
DISCONNECTED FROM THE NATURAL
WORLD AND MANY OF US, WHAT WE'RE
GUILTY OF IS AN EGO CENTRIC
WORLD VIEW, THE BELIEF THAT
WE'RE THE CENTER OF THE
UNIVERSE.
WE GO INTO THE NATURAL WORLD AND
WE PLUNDER IT FOR ITS RESOURCES.
WE FEEL ENTITLED TO ARTIFICIALLY
INSEMINATE A COW AND WHEN SHE
GIVES BIRTH, WE STEAL HER BABY.
EVEN THOUGH HER CRIES OF ANGUISH
ARE UNMISTAKABLE.
AND THEN WE TAKE HER MILK THAT'S
INTENDED FOR HER CALF AND WE PUT
IT IN OUR COFFEE AND OUR CEREAL.
AND I THINK WE FEAR THE IDEA OF
PERSONAL CHANGE BECAUSE WE THINK
THAT WE HAVE TO SACRIFICE
SOMETHING TO GIVE SOMETHING UP
BUT HUMAN BEINGS, AT OUR BEST,
ARE SO INVENTIVE AND CREATIVE
AND INGENIOUS AND I THINK THAT
WHEN WE USE LOVE AND COMPASSION
AS OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES, WE
CAN CREATE, DEVELOP AND
IMPLEMENT SYSTEMS OF CHANGE THAT
ARE BENEFICIAL TO ALL SENT YENT
BEINGS AND TO THE ENVIRONMENT.
NOW, I HAVE BEEN -- I'VE BEEN A
SCOUNDREL IN MY LIFE.
I'VE BEEN SELFISH, I'VE BEEN
CRUEL AT TIMES, HARD TO WORK
WITH AND I'M GRATEFUL, BUT SO
MANY OF YOU IN THIS ROOM HAVE
GIVEN ME A SECOND CHANCE AND I
THINK THAT'S WHEN WE'RE AT OUR
BEST, WHEN WE SUPPORT EACH
OTHER, NOT WHEN WE CANCEL EACH
OTHER OUT FOR PAST MISTAKES, BUT
WHEN WE HELP EACH OTHER TO GROW,
WHEN WE EDUCATE EACH OTHER, WHEN
WE GUIDE EACH OTHER TOWARD
REDEMPTION.
THAT IS THE BEST OF HUMANITY.
I JUST -- I WANT TO -- WHEN
YOU -- WHEN HE WAS 17, MY
BROTHER WROTE THIS LYRIC, HE
SAID, "RUN TO THE RESCUE WITH 00:04:01.041,00:00:00.000 LOVE AND PEACE WILL FOLLOW."
