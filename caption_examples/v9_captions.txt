Some people have said water bottle flips are dead.
At the same time, it's very difficult
to ignore a quarter of a billion views on Water Bottle Flip Two.
So welcome to Water Bottle Three.
Let's go!
Here we go!
Dude Perfect.
I got two bottles, two beams.
This is the double flip.
Let's go!
Woo!
Woo!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Cool guys don't look back at explosions or bottle flips.
Let's go, baby!
Let's go, baby!
Boom!
Let's get slinky with it.
Bang!
What's up, guys?
Time for a moving shot.
This is the on-the-move bottle flip.
What do we do to finish up every trick shot?
We do another trick shot.
That's right.
Oh!
Oh!
What's up, guys?

You don't really have to, but you
don't want to miss the boat.
The boat will leave at some point.
If you're watching this in 2024, it's probably too late.
The ship's left.
It'll be sooner than that, but no one knows when.
Like a thief in the night, that's when we'll give it away.
Check it out.
I just put the smallest cup I could find on a bottle.
This is the tiny cup bottle flip.
It's a little bright in here.
So we want to do a water bottle flip.
And we've done one up on that railing.
Yeah!
But we haven't done one on that railing.
That is twice as high.
Guys had some crazy ideas, but this one might top the list.
Hey, Tim.
Tell them what shot this is.
This is the super high skinny rail flip.
Let's go!
Let's go!
Yeah!
